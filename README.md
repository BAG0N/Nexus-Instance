**Nexus Instance** is a framework meant to simplify the
creation of classes in Lua, both in terms of syntax and
being able to have the context of "super". The framework
includes a base `NexusObject` class, as well as a more
powerful `NexusInstance` class to allow for locking
of properties and a `Changed` event.

## Documentation
Documentation for the framework and utilities can be found
on the [GitHub pages](https://thenexusavenger.github.io/Nexus-Instance)

of the markdown files.
